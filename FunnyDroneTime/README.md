## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

This is a drone piloter app, given the current widespread use of drones across the world for a vary of different tasks, I believe this is a project worth taking on. My current goals are to get to be execute the move commands, the camera movement command, and the release payload commands. I'll begin doing inperson tests when ever I can get my hands on the drones I have in Calgary and when Calgary stops being a frozen wasteland (May).

Movement Command: forward, back, left, right, up and down, in order to do diagonals, multiple commands are executed simulatusly. Advanced commands include circle and dive

Camera: create a camera that can move around and swivle as well as take video and pictures

Release Command: drone will have a claw attached to it, will be able to drop the payload, preferablely when on the move.
